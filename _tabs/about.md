# About Me

Hello there! My name is Zakaria and I currently serve as a Site Reliability Engineer at [Schibsted](https://www.schibsted.com/), a Norway-based media giant and operator of numerous second-hand marketplaces.

## My Work

Operating out of the picturesque city of Oslo, my work primarily revolves around overseeing observability, managing runtime environments, and driving Finops within the organization. 

### Observability 
Ensuring the maximum possible uptime, seamless inter-service interactions, and swift issue resolution are pivotal parts of my job. I help the company form a complete understanding of our systems' inner workings.

### Runtime Environments 
I manage the environments in which our application codes run. By setting up, managing and ensuring the security of these environments, I aid in efficient development and deployment of our numerous products.

### Finops
Driving efficient cloud financial operations, or 'Finops', is another critical aspect of my role. My aim is to ensure the company's cloud monetary operations run as smoothly and cost-effectively as possible.

## My Passion

I am profoundly passionate about utilizing modern technologies and methodologies to facilitate effective solutions. Throughout my career, I have dedicated myself to the exploration and adoption of innovative IT strategies to foster an environment of growth and productivity at Schibsted.

## About This Blog

This blog serves as a platform for me to share my insights, ideas, and knowledge about observability, runtime environments, FinOps , and much more! I aim to utilize this platform to converse about the challenges, solutions, and advancements in site reliability engineering.
